## Introduction

### Background
"Feeling "Quizzy" is a fun, interactive, multi-choice answer quiz website. In keeping with the tradition of pub quiz team names being pun based, "Feeling Quizzy" is based phonetically off the phrase "feeling dizzy".

The overall tone of the website is lighthearted and sometimes tongue-in-cheek. The purpose of the website is to provide a fun and interactive experience for the user, while at the same time possibly being educational.

The quiz itself consists of 20 questions from four different categories with four possible answers. In all cases, only one answer is correct, however, some of the answers themselves are ficticious. 

To provide a level of difficulty and uncertainty, some answers, such as year numbers, are deliberately similar. This is to make the user second guess themselves on an answer they would have initially been confident of.
