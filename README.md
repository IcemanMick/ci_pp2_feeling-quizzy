## Introduction

### Background
"Feeling "Quizzy" is a fun, interactive, multi-choice answer quiz website. In keeping with the tradition of pub quiz team names being pun based, "Feeling Quizzy" is based phonetically off the phrase "feeling dizzy".

The overall tone of the website is lighthearted and sometimes tongue-in-cheek. The purpose of the website is to provide a fun and interactive experience for the user, while at the same time possibly being educational.

The quiz itself consists of 20 questions from four different categories with four possible answers. In all cases, only one answer is correct, however, some of the answers themselves are ficticious. 

To provide a level of difficulty and uncertainty, some answers, such as year numbers, are deliberately similar. This is to make the user second guess themselves on an answer they would have initially been confident of. 

## Objectives

### Site Visitors
The objectives of the site visitors can be split into two categories:
1. First Time Visitors;

## Website Design

### Layout
Quiz websites should be simple and easy to navigate. The steps to start and finish a quiz should be obvious and the answer buttons should be large and appropriately spaced so that distinct answer selection is not a problem.

With too many features or complexes designs, a user may be put off, and may seek an alternative quiz option. The internet is full of interactive quizzes to choose from, so simplicity of design and execution is important to not only encourage game commencement, but also repeat visits.

The website consists of four pages:

- Home Page
- Quiz Page
- News and Feedback Page
- Timeout Page (should the user not complete the quiz in the alotted time)

### Colour Choices
The main colours used in the website are a blue/navy colour called rgba (25, 50, 190, 0.75), and a standard Light Blue with Whitesmoke borders on the buttons. These colours are in honour of the Dublin GAA jersey colours, as I'm from Dublin in Ireland.

<details><summary>Dublin Jersey</summary><img src="./assets/docs/features/002_dublin_jersey.png"></details>

The traffic lights colours of Red, Gold, and Limegreen were used for hovering over buttons and button clicks.

A second light purple/pink colour was used to provide some additional variety and distinction, without being visually jarring. This colour is called rgba (208, 71, 107,0.95).

<details><summary>rgba (208, 71, 107, 0.95)</summary><img src="./assets/docs/features/003_rgba_color2.png"></details>

Whitesmoke background was used again on the footer to alert the user to the bottom of the page and its social media links.

### Structure
Each page structure is similar with the main purpose of the page in a large heaidng at the top and a social media footer at the base. The main content (menus, answers, forms) are centrally located. This consistency ensures a positive visitor experience as the visitor never has to go looking for something; information is always where it is expected to be.

The symmetry of the four current categories on the home page and the four upcoming categories on the newsletter sign up page serve as "book-ends" to the website.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using the programme Balsamiq.

### Font
Roboto from[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is used for the website. Alternative fallback font used is Sans-Serif.
